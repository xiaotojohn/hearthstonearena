I'm wondering how efficently does the new arena recyle gold

Turned out it's pretty efficient.

Known issues:
- Used expected values for old arena random gold reward, and the calculations are only roughly accurate.
- winrate 0.727: what is this? This is more like a guessed number, which allows the players to reach average 7 wins. It should be conducted through negative binomial distribution, will try.

- will do something new.
